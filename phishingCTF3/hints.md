# Hints (Release Gradually)

1. Look at mismatches: branding, year, domain, language urgency.
2. Base64 tokens frequently end with '=' padding; check `tid` parameter.
3. Where would a Flask app store quick appended data? Search for `.log`.
4. OPSEC mistakes appear in comments and insecure token generation.
5. JSON schema lists required fields—fill each from artifacts.
